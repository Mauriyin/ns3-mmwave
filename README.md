## NR RLC layer development
Our project is based on mmWave project, see description here: [mmWave Modules](README_mmWave.md).  
Our goal is to develop the RLC layer according to the 3GPP standard on ns-3.  
The source code is currently under nr module.

## Overall design
Currently we are focusing on the NR RLC UM mode development, and using a simulated architecture for the unit test.
